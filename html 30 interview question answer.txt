30. What is the difference between html and html5?
When HTML5 was released that time  the primary objective was to improve the World Wide Web experience for developers and end-users. :

HTML5 supports SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), canvas, and also  other virtual vector graphics, but in HTML, make use of vector graphics was only possible by using it in conjunction with different technologies like Flash, VML (Vector Markup Language), or Silverlight.
Web SQL databases are normally  used in HTML5 for storing the data temporarily. In the older version of HTML we were only able to use browser cache and could be utilized for this purpose.
In HTML5 the main advantage is  JavaScript can run within a web browser, while when we talk about the older version of  HTML only allows JavaScript to run in the browser interface thread.
HTML5 is not based on SGML. The language has improved parsing rules which helps to provide enhanced compatibility.
